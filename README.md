## Getting Started

First, instal the package with composer:

```bash
composer require nystronsolar/electric-bill-extractor
```

Next, extract the data from an electric bill:

```php
<?php

use NystronSolar\ElectricBillExtractor\ExtractorFactory;

require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$bill = ExtractorFactory::extractFromFile('bill.pdf');
```

## How the library works?

### The Extractors

Each type of bill needs to have a custom extractor. Each extractor extends the [Extractor Abstract Class](src/Extractor.php), which when instantiating, you need to provide the parsed content of an bill. After it, you can extract its content by using the `extract()` method, that it will returns a bill object or false in case of error.

### The Extractor Factory

> [`NystronSolar\ElectricBillExtractor\ExtractorFactory`](src/ExtractorFactory.php)

The Extractor Factory is a class that helps

With the Extractor Factory, you can:

- Identify the extractor class from an string content or file path with the `identifyExtractorClassFromContent()` or `identifyExtractorClassFromFile()` methods
- Instantiate the extractor class from an string content or file path with the `instantiateExtractorClassFromFile()` and `instantiateExtractorClassFromFile()` methods
- Extract the bill from an string content or file path with the `extractFromFile()` and `extractFromFile()` methods

```php
<?php

use NystronSolar\ElectricBillExtractor\ExtractorFactory;

require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

// Returns an class-string of an extractor that can be used or false
ExtractorFactory::identifyExtractorClassFromFile('bill.pdf');
ExtractorFactory::identifyExtractorClassFromContent('An parsed bill content');

// Return an new extractor instance or false
ExtractorFactory::instantiateExtractorFromFile('bill.pdf');
ExtractorFactory::instantiateExtractorFromContent('An parsed bill content');

// Extract an Bill - Return an bill object or false
ExtractorFactory::extractFromFile('bill.pdf');
ExtractorFactory::extractFromContent('An parsed bill content');
```

## Tests

The tests for the Electric Bill Extractor are pretty!

### Content

To test an File Extractor library, we need to have many files to extract and check the results. And that's because, in the Electric Bill Extractor, under the `tests/Content/bills/` folder, you can find many `.txt` files that represents many fake bills, following the pattern for each extractor.

And to compare the results by the extractor and the actual bills, you can find `.json` files in `tests/Content/expected/` that when the tests run, it will compare the expected (json) with the actual bills (txt)

#### Why not use PDF files?

In most real-cases, projects will extract the data from an PDF file. In that approach, the Electric Bill Extractor will parse the PDF file into text, using the [https://github.com/smalot/pdfparser](smalot/pdfparser).

After the parsing, the library will use the text returned from the Parser and extract all the data for the bill.

But in tests, we can skip all the parsing. And that's because we use `.txt` instead of `.pdf`

### The Test Case

Since the extractor have this "strange" way to assert the classes, we built the [Extractor Test Case](tests/TestCase/ExtractorTestCase.php), which is a Custom PHPUnit Test Case. This test case have an `assertByContentFolder` method, which you need to provide the folder name and the extractor class.
